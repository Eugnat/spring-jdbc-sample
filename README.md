# spring-jdbc-sample
A small demo project where Spring Data JDBC technology is demonstrated (JdbcTemplate is used).

Some JDBC queries are demonstrated using a simplified DAO approach (DAO interfance and Service implementation).
JavaConfig is applied, so no XML configuration, only annotations are used. The current Spring JDBC and Spring Context versions
were used, so you may apply it as a Spring JDBC template.
